### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Leon and I am a 19-year-old computer science student whose passion is web development. At the moment I have decent knowledge about frontend, but in the future, I would like to become a full-stack developer. Currently, I am studying at the Slovak University of Technology, Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies. For the past 2.5 years, I have been learning programming and mastering frontend web development skills in my free time.
